## Simple React Application with Next.js, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, and React-Hook-Form

This project is a simple React application built with Next.js that demonstrates how to post and fetch data from an API and display it with pagination and search functionality.

- Loading Indicator: Show a loading spinner while fetching data.
- Error Handling: Display an error message if the API request fails.
